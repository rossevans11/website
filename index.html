    <h1>The Interface Theory Of Perception</h1>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_D._Hoffman"target="_blank">Donald Hoffman</a> is a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Irvine. His work in this field, and his observation that the probability that our perceptions are a veridical representation of objective reality is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely"target="_blank"> almost surely</a> zero, led him to propose a radical new theory.</p>

    <p>You could be forgiven for thinking, that species whose perceptual frameworks provide the most accurate rendering of reality, would be better equipped to navigate the world, and thus, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory"target="_blank">evolutionary game theory</a> terms, always be able to out compete species whose senses convey only sufficient information to allow them to successfully seek fitness payoffs. As it turns out, this doesn't seem to be the case, and what Hoffman discovered, is that in every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory"target="_blank">EGT</a> simulation, the organisms whose perceptions were tuned to fitness payoffs, prospered, those who perceived a truer representation of the worldspace, perished.</p>

    <p>This result was very much contrary to Hoffman's expectations, and combined with his other work, led him to   consider that our own perceptions may represent something akin to an interface, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"target=_blank">satisficing solution</a> to the problem of dealing with the complexity of objective reality, but in no way an accurate or veridical representation of it.</p>    

    <p>In simple terms, Hoffman's theory argues that we do not perceive objective reality, rather our perceptions are a species specific interface, tuned to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory"target="_blank"> fitness payoffs</a>, and not to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veridicality"target="_blank">veridicality</a>. By way of analogy, a computer user interface is designed to hide the underlying complexity of the hardware, thus allowing us to be productive without having to manually change transistor states to get anything done. When you drop a file into the trash on your desktop, that action is not a literal representation of what is happening inside the computer's hardware, rather it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism"target="_blank">homomorphism</a>, between an action taken within the user interface, and the outcome that action results in at the hardware level.</p> 

    
    <h2>There is <span class="literally">Literally</span> No Spoon</h2>

    <p>A major claim of Hoffman, is that spacetime (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space"target="_blank">Minkowski Space</a>) does not exist, or more accurately, it isn't a fundamental structure. This isn't as outlandish as it may seem, as the theoretical physics community is also starting to <a href="https://pswscience.org/meeting/the-doom-of-spacetime/" target="_blank">coalesce around this conclusion.</a></p>

    
    <p>In Hoffman's view, the 4-dimensional manifold we perceive as spacetime, is just a projection into our perceptual interface from objective reality; a realm of <a href="http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/HoffmanTime.pdf"target="_blank"</a>conscious agents</a> unbound by temporality. Where he goes further than the physics community is currently ready to, is that he also contends that all physical objects, from the largest to the smallest, are merely data structures projected into our interface, and which have no causal powers. Again, the computer desktop interface is a useful analogy here. When you drop a file in the trash, the action you take within the user interface (dragging the file to the trash icon) is not causative. It appears causative, because that's what a good interface is supposed to do; make you believe that there is a correlating function between an action you take, and an apparent consequence of that action.</p>

    <p>Hoffman gives the example of a bus hurtling towards you. He contends that whilst it is merely a data structure, comprised of a network of conscious agents in objective reality, and with no causal powers, because of the homomorphic nature of the connection between our perceptual interface and objective reality, it can still cause you harm. In essence, in objective reality, whatever interaction of networks of conscious agents represents a collision between a person and a bus, the result is projected as a data structure and interpreted by our perceptual interface.</p>


    <p>This is a precis of what is a complex and conceptually quite oblique theory. Whilst it may seem like pseudo philosophical existential handwringing, there is a solid mathematical foundation to the theory, and as it progresses, experimentally testable hypotheses will emerge.</p>
